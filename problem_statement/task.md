# Overview of Generated Java and Python Code

This repository contains several Java and Python example code files generated from a JSONL file.

## Code Overview

- **Java Files**  
  These files implement small functions, such as computing the sum and product of a list or performing binary XOR.  
  The code works correctly but is relatively simple. Comments and test code are included directly in the same file.  
  There is room for improvement in performance optimization, exception handling, and code reusability.

- **Python Files**  
  These files include basic functions like removing duplicates and sorting a list.  
  They have clear comments and docstrings, but the functionality is basic. The code quality is low and mainly suitable for practice or examples.

## Overall Assessment

The code quality is low. These files are primarily for demonstrating functionality and testing methods, suitable for learning, practice, or preliminary experiments.
